# TweenDeck

Next level animation for web presentations.

View the demo/docs at [johnpolacek.github.io/tweendeck](https://johnpolacek.github.io/tweendeck/).

TweenDeck is powered by the [Greensock Animation Platform (GSAP)](https://greensock.com/) which is its only dependency.

*Note: Greensock has plugins like [SplitText](https://greensock.com/SplitText) and [MorphSVG](https://greensock.com/morphSVG) that are exclusive to Greensock members. For truly next-level animations, I highly recommend becoming joining [Club Greensock](https://greensock.com/club/).*
